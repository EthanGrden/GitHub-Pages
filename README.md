Today at the store I bought cheese for $2.50, Burgers for $3.00, Nachos for $4.00, and Coldcuts for $2.50. This was a very good day at the store and I would come back to buy these same items because most of them were on sale and it is a really nice day out. I now have lots of food at my house which I will eat in the days to pass while we are quarantined. All the prices were in terms of what I bought today and are not guarranted to be the same in the following days
